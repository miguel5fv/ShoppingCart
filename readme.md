The structure file:

- ApplicationLayer - Here I have included presentationLayer to keep it simple
- DomainLayer
- InfrastructureLayer - Contains repositories? and persistence. @see http://www.refactoringideas.com/multilayered-architecture-4-the-infrastructure-layer/

Comes from the book of Eric Evans, here it is referred from Martin Fowler http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html
